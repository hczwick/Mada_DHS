Data source: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/who-data-for-madagascar

# This is a non-work project for me to explore datasets related to my interests
# and gain practice with my R skills. I will start with exploratory analysis
# and see if anything interesting arises to pursue and analyze further.

# My interest in Madagascar stems from my time there in the Peace Corps, and my
# interest in infectious diseases is longstanding and was furthered through
# my masters degree in Global Health, where I focused on research on Ebola,
# tuberculosis, and vaccine hesitancy.
